# 📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This portfolio project showcases the end-to-end development of a modern data warehousing and analytics solution. From data ingestion to actionable insights, it demonstrates industry best practices across data engineering, data modeling, and analytics.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** approach, dividing the data warehouse into **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

- **Bronze Layer**  
  - Raw data ingested from source systems (ERP & CRM) via CSV files.  
  - Stored as-is in **SQL Server**.

- **Silver Layer**  
  - Cleaned, validated, and standardized data.  
  - Ready for analytical modeling.

- **Gold Layer**  
  - Business-ready data organized in a **star schema**.  
  - Optimized for reporting and analytics use cases.
